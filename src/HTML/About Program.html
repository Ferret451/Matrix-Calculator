  <h1>About the Author</h1>
  <p>Hello there!</p>
  <p>My name is Gabrus Stanislau Pavlovich, and I am a student at Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics (BSUIR). I belong to the group 251003.</p>
  <p>I recently developed a matrix calculator as part of my coursework project. However, I must admit that I started working on it quite late, which resulted in some unfinished functionalities.</p>
  <p>Despite the limitations, I did my best to implement the essential features and deliver a functional matrix calculator.</p>
  <p>Thank you for checking out my program!</p>
